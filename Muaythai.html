            <h2>Muay Thai</h2>
            <p>Muay Thai, also known as Thai boxing, is a combat sport that originated in Thailand. It is known as the "Art of Eight Limbs" because it utilizes fists, elbows, knees, and shins for striking. Muay Thai also incorporates clinch fighting techniques, where opponents engage in close combat, and throws to gain advantage.</p>
            <p>Muay Thai is deeply rooted in Thai culture and has a long history of being practiced as a martial art and a form of self-defense. Traditionally, Muay Thai training was an integral part of military training in Thailand.</p>
            <p>Modern Muay Thai is widely practiced around the world, both as a competitive sport and as a fitness regimen. It has gained popularity for its effectiveness in developing striking skills, physical conditioning, and mental discipline.</p>
            <p>Training in Muay Thai typically includes techniques such as punches, kicks, elbows, and knee strikes, as well as defensive maneuvers like blocking and evasion. Practitioners also engage in sparring sessions to apply their skills in a controlled environment.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Muay Thai training emphasizes the importance of respect, discipline, and sportsmanship. Many practitioners find that the mental and emotional benefits of Muay Thai extend beyond the physical aspects, helping them build confidence and resilience.</p>

        <div class="comparison">
            <h2>Boxing</h2>
            <p>Boxing is a combat sport that involves two opponents throwing punches at each other within a roped-off square ring. The goal is to land clean punches on the opponent while avoiding their punches. Unlike Muay Thai, which incorporates various striking techniques using fists, elbows, knees, and shins, boxing focuses solely on punches.</p>
            <p>Boxing has a rich history dating back to ancient times, with evidence of boxing-like sports found in civilizations such as ancient Greece and Rome. In modern times, boxing has evolved into a regulated sport with various weight classes and rules to ensure fair competition.</p>
            <p>Training in boxing involves a combination of cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and skill development. Boxers typically spend hours honing their punching technique, footwork, and defensive maneuvers to become proficient in the sport.</p>
            <p>Boxing matches are scored based on the number of clean punches landed, defense, and overall ring control. Knockouts, where one fighter is unable to continue, or technical knockouts, where the referee stops the fight due to one fighter's inability to defend themselves, are also common outcomes of boxing matches.</p>
            <p>Aside from its competitive aspect, boxing is also widely practiced as a form of fitness training. Many people turn to boxing workouts to improve their cardiovascular health, strength, and coordination while learning valuable self-defense skills.</p>
